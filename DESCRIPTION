Description: Statistical tools for ChIP-seq data analysis. The package includes the statistical  method described in Kaufmann et al. (2009) PLoS Biology: 7(4):e1000090. Briefly, Taking the average DNA fragment size subjected to sequencing into account, the software calculates genomic single-nucleotide read-enrichment values. After normalization, sample and control are compared using a test based on the Poisson distribution. Test statistic thresholds to control the false discovery rate are obtained through random permutation.
